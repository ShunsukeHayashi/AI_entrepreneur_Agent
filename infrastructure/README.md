# Infrastructure Layer

The infrastructure layer will house infrastructure-as-code assets and operational runbooks for the AI Entrepreneur Agent platform.

## Responsibilities
- Capture Terraform modules, Kubernetes manifests, and deployment automations for all services.
- Define observability baselines, including logging, metrics, and alerting pipelines.
- Document environment topology spanning development, staging, and production.

## Planned Tooling
- Terraform for cloud resource provisioning (final provider modules pending selection).
- Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts to orchestrate containerized services on AWS.
- GitHub Actions workflows and container registries to support CI/CD pipelines.

## Next Steps
- Outline environment bootstrap procedures and IaC conventions once Story S-005 commences.
- Coordinate with security stakeholders to record compliance and secret-management requirements.
- Track open decisions around infrastructure tooling in this README via TODO notes.

> **TODO**: Confirm Terraform vs. Pulumi decision and align with platform engineering stakeholders.
