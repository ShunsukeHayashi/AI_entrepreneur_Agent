# AI Engine Layer

The AI engine layer will host Python-based services that deliver machine learning inference and decision-support tooling.

## Responsibilities
- Implement data pipelines, model training, and inference workflows for venture analysis.
- Orchestrate integrations with third-party AI APIs and manage prompt templates.
- Provide CLI utilities and background workers consumed by the backend.

## Planned Tooling
- Python 3.9.6 with Poetry or pip/virtualenv for dependency management (final decision pending).
- TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and OpenAI SDKs based on workload requirements.
- pytest for automated testing and mypy/ruff for static analysis (to be finalized).

## Next Steps
- Establish the Python package structure with `src/` and `tests/` directories in Story S-004.
- Introduce dependency management files and stub CLI entry points.
- Define data governance guidelines for model artifacts and datasets.
