# AI Engine

## Responsibilities
- Host machine learning pipelines for research synthesis, business modeling, and autonomous agent workflows.
- Implement data pipelines, model training, and inference services that deliver venture insights.
- Provide inference APIs, CLI utilities, and background workers consumed by the backend orchestration layer.

## Planned Scaffolding
- Story S-004 will establish a Python package layout with CLI entry points and dependency management.
- Future iterations will add model registries, experiment tracking, and dataset management utilities.

## Tooling Roadmap
- Python 3.9.6 environment with Poetry or pip/virtualenv for dependency management (final decision pending).
- TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and OpenAI SDKs based on workload requirements.
- pytest for automated testing with fixtures for mock data artifacts, plus prospective mypy/ruff static analysis.

## Next Steps
- Establish the Python package structure with `src/` and `tests/` directories in Story S-004.
- Introduce dependency management files and stub CLI entry points.
- Define data governance guidelines for model artifacts and datasets.

## Open Questions
- Final selection between TensorFlow and PyTorch for core pipelines awaits benchmarking and team consensus.
