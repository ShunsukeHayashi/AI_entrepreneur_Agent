# Frontend

## Responsibilities
- Deliver the user-facing React application for venture orchestration workflows.
- Provide dashboards, configuration panels, and progress visualizations that interact with backend APIs.
- Surface real-time insights generated by the AI engine in a collaborative UI.

## Planned Scaffolding
- Story S-003 will bootstrap a TypeScript-based React SPA with routing and test utilities.
- Future iterations will add shared UI components, design system integration, and state management.

## Tooling Roadmap
- Vite (or CRA alternative) with ESLint/Prettier shared rules inherited from the monorepo.
- Testing Library plus Vitest/Jest combination for component and integration coverage.

## Next Steps
- Establish the base layout, router, and lint/test scripts in Story S-003.
- Define API gateway hooks for communicating with the backend health endpoint (mockable during development).

## Open Questions
- Final selection of the design system (Material UI vs. custom) remains pending collaboration with product design.
