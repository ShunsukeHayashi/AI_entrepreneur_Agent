# Backend

## Responsibilities
- Expose RESTful endpoints that orchestrate venture workflows, persist data, and proxy AI engine calls.
- Manage venture data persistence, authentication, and access control policies.
- Coordinate long-running workflows and stream progress updates to the frontend.
- Integrate with the AI engine and external data providers.

## Planned Scaffolding
- Story S-002 will initialize an Express server with health check endpoints and Jest-based tests.
- Subsequent stories will add PostgreSQL integration, background workers, and message queue adapters.

## Tooling Roadmap
- Node.js 18+ with Express and TypeScript support, leveraging shared ESLint/Prettier settings from the workspace root.
- PostgreSQL via an ORM (Prisma or TypeORM under evaluation) for relational data access.
- Testing stack anchored by Jest with Supertest for HTTP verification.

## Next Steps
- Scaffold the Express server, health check endpoint, and test harness in Story S-002.
- Define configuration management via environment variables and `.env` templates.
- Document API versioning and authentication strategies as part of upcoming stories.

## Open Questions
- Detailed authentication strategy (JWT vs. session) and multi-tenant data modeling are deferred to future architecture reviews.
