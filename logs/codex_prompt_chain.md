# Codex Prompt Chain Log

## Story S-001: Define Monorepo Structure and Tooling
- Session Date: 2025-09-24
- Agent: Codex

### Intent
- Align repository scaffolding with PRD acceptance criteria for Story S-001.
- Ensure root documentation and tooling describe the monorepo workspace and LDD workflow expectations.

### Plan
1. Review the current repository state, `.ai` approvals, and existing documentation to identify gaps.
2. Refresh root documentation (`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`) so the workspace layout, tooling, and logging workflow are explicit.
3. Introduce a `logs/` directory with templates for prompt chains, tool invocations, and handoff summaries; update `.gitignore` if required.
4. Capture completion notes in `.ai/story` and mark PRD status once acceptance criteria are satisfied.

### Implementation
- Collected repository context using `git status`, directory listings, and document inspections.
- Updated `README.md` setup steps and layout diagram to reference `npm install` and the new `logs/` artifacts.
- Clarified `CONTRIBUTING.md` development workflow to store LDD records under `logs/`.
- Added `logs/README.md`, `logs/codex_prompt_chain.md`, `logs/tool_invocations.md`, and `logs/handoff_summary.md`, and removed the `logs/` ignore rule so artifacts can be tracked.
- Recorded completion details in `.ai/story/☑️-S-001-plan.md` and set `.ai/prd.md` Story S-001 status to `Completed`.

### Verification
- Manually reviewed documentation diffs and ensured new logging artifacts exist with expected guidance.
- Confirmed `.gitignore` exposes `logs/` via `git status --short` and acceptance criteria captured in the story plan.

### Handoff
- Story S-001 scaffolding ready for downstream review; next action is to kick off Story S-002 once approved.
- Recommend running `npm install` to hydrate shared devDependencies ahead of backend scaffolding work.
