# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

- **Status**: Approved
- **Current Epic**: E-001 Platform Foundation
- **Next Actions**: Transition to Story S-002 backend scaffolding after reviewing S-001 deliverables.

## Epic E-001: Platform Foundation

- **Status**: Proposed
- **Goal**: Establish the minimal repository structure, developer tooling, and service scaffolds required to support incremental feature delivery across frontend, backend, and AI engine components.
- **Success Metrics**:
  - Developers can install dependencies and run lint/test placeholders for each service layer.
  - CI pipeline validates formatting/lint hooks on every push.
  - Monorepo structure and documentation enable onboarding within one working day.

### Story S-001: Define Monorepo Structure and Tooling

- **Status**: Completed
- **Description**: Create the directory layout, shared configuration (e.g., linting, formatting), and developer documentation that align with the documented architecture.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Repository contains top-level folders for `frontend`, `backend`, `ai-engine`, and `infrastructure` with placeholder READMEs outlining responsibilities.
  - Root-level tooling (e.g., `.editorconfig`, lint configs) is introduced and documented.
  - Contributor guide documents how to set up local environments for each component.

### Story S-002: Scaffold Backend API Service

- **Status**: Completed
- **Description**: Initialize an Express-based Node.js service with baseline routing, environment configuration, and test harness.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - `backend` contains a bootstrapped Express server with health check endpoint and Jest (or equivalent) test setup.
  - Environment variables are managed via `.env.example` and documented in backend README.
  - npm scripts cover `start`, `dev`, `test`, and lint commands.
- **Dependencies**: Story S-001.

### Story S-003: Scaffold Frontend React Application

- **Status**: Completed
- **Description**: Bootstrap a React SPA with TypeScript, routing, and component testing utilities.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - `frontend` contains a Create React App (or Vite)-based scaffold with TypeScript support.
  - Base layout renders a placeholder dashboard view connected to the backend health endpoint (mockable).
  - Testing library configured with one sample test.
- **Dependencies**: Story S-001.

### Story S-004: Bootstrap AI Engine Service

- **Status**: Proposed
- **Description**: Set up a Python 3.9.6 project structure with virtual environment tooling, dependency management, and placeholder modules for pipelines.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - `ai-engine` contains a Python package layout with `src/` and `tests/` directories.
  - Dependency management file (`requirements.txt` or `poetry.lock`) lists essential baseline libraries.
  - CLI entry point exposes a stub command (e.g., `python -m ai_engine.cli run` returning placeholder output).
- **Dependencies**: Story S-001.

### Story S-005: Configure CI and Containerization Baseline

- **Status**: Proposed
- **Description**: Provide initial GitHub Actions workflow and Dockerfiles that validate lint/tests and build container images for each service.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - GitHub Actions workflow runs on pull requests, executing lint/test scripts for backend, frontend, and AI engine.
  - Dockerfiles exist for each service with documented build instructions.
  - README references CI badges/placeholders and explains deployment assumptions.
- **Dependencies**: Stories S-001, S-002, S-003, S-004.
