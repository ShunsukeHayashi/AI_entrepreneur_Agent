# .ai Directory Guide

The `.ai/` directory stores planning artifacts shared across the AI toolchain.

- `prd.md`: Authoritative product requirements and story approvals.
- `arch.md`: Architecture decisions and design gates.
- Additional files may be added for sprint-level tracking or checklists.

Always consult these documents before writing implementation code.
